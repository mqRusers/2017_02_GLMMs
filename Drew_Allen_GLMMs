Jags - bayesian (gold standard)
mcmcglmm (also good)
lme4, nlme, jags (when possible use all three!)

Assumptions
- Absence of collinearity, 
- normality of errors, 
- independence, 
- no influential data points, 
- homoskedasticity of errors

Repeated (seasonal?) measures at some sites- no longer completely independent
Conditional independence

LMM/GLMM can handle repeated measures and unblanced data, and crossed random effects
GLMM can handle non-normally distributed response data. 

Calculate correlation between slopes and intercepts. 


linear regression : R~T  (respiration, temp)
random intercept model: R~T+(1|site)
slope and intercept correlated R~T+(T|site)

Sources of convergence problems
-not enough data
-collinearity
-predictors have vastly different scales (can usually be solved with a transformation of predictors)

Solutions:
- SImplify (drop a random slope)
- Remove items with not enough data
- lmerControl() (the 'optimizer') increase the number of iterations; last-ditch effort


Random (categories distinct but interchangeable) vs. fixed effects (when you care about the identities of the categorical variables)

Best method of model fitting is still debated
